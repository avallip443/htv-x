GUIDELINES:
- Total length: 400-600 words
- Each event: 100-150 words
- Plain English, minimal jargon
- Include both good and bad news
- Prioritize events before price moves
- One authoritative source per event
- Dates from document bodies only
CRITICAL WRITING RULES:
1. Executive Summary - Lead with Impact: Open with the most dramatic fact (biggest loss, largest gain, most shocking revelation), then explain causes
2. Before/After Framing: In each event's "Story" section, the first sentence should establish what the situation was BEFORE the event, then show how it changed AFTER
   - Example: "Meta had never lost daily users in its 18-year history. Then Q4 2021 revealed the first decline, dropping 500,000 users as TikTok captured younger audiences."
   - NOT: "Meta reported a decline in daily users in Q4 2021."
